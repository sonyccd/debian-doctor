A comprehensive offline system diagnostic and troubleshooting tool for Debian-based systems. Debian Doctor helps you identify and resolve common system issues without requiring internet connectivity.

## üöÄ Features

### Automatic System Analysis
- **System Information** - OS version, kernel, architecture, uptime
- **Disk Space Analysis** - Usage monitoring with critical/warning thresholds
- **Memory Analysis** - RAM and swap usage with pressure detection
- **Service Status** - Critical system services health check
- **Network Configuration** - Interface status, IP addresses, routing, DNS
- **Filesystem Health** - Error detection and mount status
- **System Logs** - Recent error analysis from systemd journal
- **Package System** - Broken packages and lock detection

### Interactive Problem Diagnosis
When automatic checks don't identify issues, Debian Doctor provides guided troubleshooting for:

1. **Boot Issues** - System startup problems
2. **Performance Problems** - Slow system response
3. **Network Connectivity** - Connection and DNS issues
4. **Disk/Storage Issues** - Space and I/O problems
5. **Service Problems** - Application startup failures
6. **Display/Graphics Issues** - GUI and driver problems
7. **Package Management** - APT and dpkg issues
8. **Permission/Access Issues** - File and directory access
9. **Custom Diagnosis** - General troubleshooting guidance

## üìä Understanding Output

### Status Indicators
- **‚úì Green**: System is healthy
- **‚ö† Yellow**: Warning - attention recommended
- **‚úó Red**: Error - immediate action required
- **‚Ñπ Blue**: Information - no action needed

### Severity Levels

#### Critical Issues (Red)
- Disk usage > 95%
- Memory usage > 90%
- Failed critical services
- Filesystem errors
- Root filesystem read-only

#### Warnings (Yellow)
- Disk usage > 85%
- Memory usage > 80%
- High swap usage
- Interface down
- No DNS servers

#### Information (Blue)
- System specifications
- Normal status messages
- Helpful tips and suggestions

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

### Running Specific Checks
While the script doesn't support individual check selection, you can extract functions for custom use:

```bash
# Source the script to use individual functions
source debian_doctor.sh

# Run specific checks
check_disk_space
check_memory
check_services
```

### Customizing Thresholds
Edit the script to modify warning/error thresholds:

```bash
# Disk space thresholds
if [[ $usage -gt 95 ]]; then    # Critical threshold
if [[ $usage -gt 85 ]]; then    # Warning threshold

# Memory thresholds  
if [[ $mem_usage_percent -gt 90 ]]; then  # Critical
if [[ $mem_usage_percent -gt 80 ]]; then  # Warning
```

### Log Analysis
All activities are logged to `/tmp/debian_doctor.log`:

```bash
# View the log
cat /tmp/debian_doctor.log

# Monitor in real-time
tail -f /tmp/debian_doctor.log
```

## üîç Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### "Permission denied" errors
**Solution**: Run with sudo for full functionality
```bash
sudo ./debian_doctor.sh
```

#### Script won't execute
**Solution**: Check permissions and shebang
```bash
chmod +x debian_doctor.sh
file debian_doctor.sh  # Should show "Bash script"
```

#### Missing dependencies
**Solution**: Install required packages
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install bc net-tools iproute2
```

#### False positives
Some warnings may be expected in your environment:
- Container environments may show unusual filesystem layouts
- Virtual machines may report different hardware information
- Test systems may have intentionally high resource usage
