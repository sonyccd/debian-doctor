# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

Debian Doctor is a system diagnostic tool that analyzes sensitive system information and can execute privileged operations. We take security seriously and appreciate your help in keeping the project secure.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### **Privileged Operations**
- Debian Doctor can run with root privileges for comprehensive system analysis
- The tool can execute system commands as part of fix suggestions
- File permission analysis may access sensitive system files
- Network diagnostics may reveal system configuration details

### **Data Handling**
- System information is logged to temporary files
- Log files may contain sensitive system details
- No data is transmitted externally by default
- All operations are performed locally on the target system

### **Code Execution**
- Fix suggestions may include shell commands
- All fixes require explicit user confirmation
- Risk levels are assigned to all suggested fixes
- Reversible operations are preferred where possible

## üö® Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ‚úÖ Fully supported |
| < 1.0   | ‚ùå Not supported   |

**Supported Distribution Channels:**
- ‚úÖ Snap Store (stable and edge channels)
- ‚úÖ GitHub Releases (official releases)
- ‚úÖ Debian packages (.deb files)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Best Practices for Users

### **Running Debian Doctor Safely**

1. **Review Fix Suggestions**
   - Always read fix descriptions before applying
   - Understand the risk level of each suggested fix
   - Test fixes in non-production environments when possible

2. **Log File Security**
   - Debian Doctor creates log files in `/tmp/debian-doctor-*.log`
   - These files may contain sensitive system information
   - Review and clean up log files after diagnosis
   - Consider running `shred -u /tmp/debian-doctor-*.log` to securely delete

3. **Privilege Management**
   - Run with minimal necessary privileges
   - Use `sudo` only when full system analysis is required
   - Avoid running as root unless necessary

4. **Network Considerations**
   - Network diagnostic features test connectivity
   - Be aware of what network information might be exposed
   - Review network tests before running in sensitive environments

### **Installation Security**

- **Verify Checksums**: Always verify SHA256 checksums for downloaded binaries
- **Use Official Sources**: Download only from GitHub Releases or Snap Store
- **Keep Updated**: Install security updates promptly

## üìã Known Security Considerations

### **By Design (Not Vulnerabilities)**

1. **Root Access**: Tool requires root for comprehensive system analysis
2. **Command Execution**: Fix suggestions may execute shell commands
3. **File System Access**: Permission analysis accesses system files
4. **Log Files**: Diagnostic information is logged to disk

### **Mitigation Controls**

- All fix executions require explicit user confirmation
- Risk levels are clearly displayed for all suggested fixes
- Commands are shown to users before execution
- Logging can be disabled or customized
- All operations are performed locally (no external communication)
